#### Linear Functions (Graphing)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz8zVJxRFX8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz8zVJxRFX8)

**Slope**

When you have two points $$(x_1, y_1)$$ and $$(x_2, y_2)$$ and need to find the steepness ($$m$$).

$$slope(m) = rise/run$$

&#x20;$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

* $$(2, 3)$$ and $$(5, 9)$$
* $$m = \frac{9 - 3}{5 - 2}$$

***

**Slope-Intercept**:  $$y=mx+b$$

When you know the slope and where the line hits the y-axis (the y-intercept), or when you need to graph a line quickly.

$$m = -\frac{1}{2}$$ and $$b = 4$$

* $$y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 4$$
* $$y = -\frac{1}{2}(10) + 4 \rightarrow y = -5 + 4$$.
* $$y = -1$$

***

**Point-Slope**: $$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$&#x20;

Use it when you have a slope and any point (not necessarily the y-intercept)

Write the equation of a line that has a slope of $$3$$ and passes through the point $$(4, -1)$$.

* Identify $$m = 3$$, $$x_1 = 4$$, and $$y_1 = -1$$.
* $$y - (-1) = 3(x - 4)$$
* $$y + 1 = 3(x - 4)$$
* $$y + 1 = 3(x - 4)$$

***

**Standard Form**: $$Ax + By = C$$. used it to find intercepts easily or to solve systems of equations using the "Elimination"

Find the x-intercept and y-intercept for the line $$3x + 4y = 12$$.

* To find the x-intercept, set $$y=0$$ ⇒ $$3x + 4(0) = 12 \rightarrow 3x = 12 \rightarrow x = 4$$.
* To find the y-intercept, set $$x=0$$ ⇒ $$3(0) + 4y = 12 \rightarrow 4y = 12 \rightarrow y = 3$$.
* The line hits the x-axis at $$(4, 0)$$ and the y-axis at $$(0, 3)$$.

#### Linear Inequalities

If you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you must flip the direction of the inequality sign.

* $$-2x < 10$$, then $$x > -5$$.

Adding or subtracting numbers does not change the sign, even if the numbers are negative.

#### Systems of Equations

Substitution and Elimination methods.

$$y=3x, x+y=16$$ (Substitution)&#x20;

$$x+y=10, x-y=2$$ (Elimination).

#### Absolute Value Equations

Use it when you need to find exact points. For example, if you are 5 miles away from a landmark, you could be at two specific points (5 miles north or 5 miles south).

$$|ax + b| = c$$:

1. Isolate the absolute value expression on one side.
2. Split into two separate equations:
   * Case 1: $$ax + b = c$$
   * Case 2: $$ax + b = -c$$
3. Solve both equations for $$x$$.
4. Check for extraneous solutions (if you started with an equation like $$|x| = -5$$, there is no solution because distance cannot be negative).

#### Exponents and Radicals

Understanding the rules of "repeated multiplication."

* Product rule, Power rule, and Quotient rule.
* $$x^4 \cdot x^5 = x^9$$ and $$\sqrt{x+2}=5$$.

#### Polynomials and Factoring

Factoring trinomials and recognizing the "Difference of Squares."

$$(x+4)(x+5)$$ and $$(x-7)(x+7)$$.

radical into fraction exponent

$$\sqrt[3]{x^2} = x^{2/3}$$

#### Quadratic Functions

Solving for $$x$$ when the variable is squared, using square roots, and the Quadratic Formula.

$$x^2=64$$ and $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$.

discriminant ($$D$$) is the formula found under the square root in the quadratic formula:

$$D = b^2 - 4ac$$

$$6x^2 + 11x - 10 = 0$$

* $$a = 6$$, $$b = 11$$, and $$c = -10$$.
* $$D = (11)^2 - 4(6)(-10)$$
* $$D = 121 + 240 = \mathbf{361}$$

#### **Complex & imaginary number**

$$a + bi$$

* $$i = \sqrt{-1}$$
* $$i^2 = -1$$
* $$x = \sqrt{-9} \rightarrow \sqrt{9} \cdot \sqrt{-1} \rightarrow \mathbf{3i}$$

**The Cycle of** $$i$$

One of the most unique things about $$i$$ is that it repeats in a four-step cycle when you raise it to higher powers.&#x20;

* $$i^1 = i$$
* $$i^2 = -1$$
* $$i^3 = -i$$
* $$i^4 = 1$$ (The cycle then restarts: $$i^5$$ is the same as $$i^1$$)

**Multiplication (FOIL)**

$$(2 + i)(3 + i)$$

$$6 + 5i + i^2$$

$$6 + 5i - 1 = \mathbf{5 + 5i}$$

#### **General Transformation**&#x20;

**General transformation** is used to describe how a "parent" graph is moved, stretched, or flipped on a coordinate plane. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkP1LJR2PyM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkP1LJR2PyM)

$$f(x) = a \cdot b^{x-h} + k$$

The **Vertical** Shift ($$k$$)

* The value of $$k$$ controls the Horizontal Asymptote (the invisible floor).&#x20;
* If $$k$$ is positive ($$+3$$): The entire graph slides up 3 units. Your "floor" moves from $$y=0$$ to $$y=3$$.
* If $$k$$ is negative ($$-5$$): The entire graph slides down 5 units. Your "floor" is now at $$y=-5$$.

The **Horizontal** $$h$$ value sits in the exponent with $$x$$. This transformation moves the graph in the opposite direction of the sign you see.

* If you see $$(x - 3)$$: The graph moves Right 3 units.
* If you see $$(x + 2)$$: The graph moves Left 2 units.
* Why is it backward? To get the same output ($$y$$) as the original graph, you now have to use an $$x$$ value that is 3 units larger to "cancel out" the $$-3$$.

The **Vertical Stretch/Compression** $$a$$ value (the number in front) acts like you are grabbing the graph and pulling it taller or squishing it flatter.

* If $$|a| > 1$$: The graph gets "steep" faster (Vertical Stretch).
* If $$0 < |a| < 1$$: The graph looks flatter (Vertical Compression).
* If $$a$$ is negative ($$-a$$): The graph flips over the x-axis. Instead of exploding upward, it explodes downward.

$$f(x) = 2^{x-3} + 1$$:

1. Identify $$k$$: The asymptote is at $$y = 1$$. Draw a dashed line there first.
2. Identify $$h$$: The graph is moved Right 3.
3.  Find Y-Intercept: Plug in $$x = 0$$ to find exactly where it hits the y-axis.

    $$f(0) = 2^{0-3} + 1 = 2^{-3} + 1 = \frac{1}{8} + 1 = 1.125$$

#### Polynomial Functions

use a polynomial when you have a set of data and you want to find a "best-fit" curve to describe it.

$$f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0$$

* $$x$$: The variable.
* $$n$$: The degree (the highest exponent). It must be a whole number ($$0, 1, 2, \dots$$).
* $$a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots$$: The coefficients (real numbers).
* $$a_n$$: The leading coefficient (the number attached to the highest power).
* $$a_0$$: The constant term (the number with no variable).

**Synthetic Division**

main goal of synthetic division is to provide a "shorthand" or shortcut for polynomial division.

$$x^3 - 4x^2 + 9$$ by $$(x - 3)$$

#### Rational Function

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irSg7rstDf0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irSg7rstDf0)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTbNc-0Klb0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTbNc-0Klb0)

$$f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$

$$q(x) \neq 0$$ (the zero polynomial)

**Vertical Asymptote**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A vertical asymptote happens when the denominator is zero, and the problem cannot be fixed.

* You factor the function, and the factor in the bottom stays there. It doesn't cancel out.
* The graph "explodes" As you get closer to that $$x$$-value, the $$y$$-values shoot up to $$+\infty$$ or down to $$-\infty$$. It’s like a wall the graph can never cross.
* $$f(x) = \frac{1}{x-3}$$. At $$x=3$$, the denominator is zero. There is no $$(x-3)$$ on top to cancel it, so $$x=3$$ is a Vertical Asymptote.

**Hole**

A hole (Removable Discontinuity) happens when the denominator is zero, but the problem is "canceled out" by the numerator.&#x20;

* A factor appears in both the top and bottom. You can "cancel" them to simplify the function.
* The graph looks like a perfectly normal, smooth line or curve, but If you were drawing it with a pencil, you’d lift the pencil for one millisecond and then keep going.
* Example: $$f(x) = \frac{(x-3)(x+2)}{x-3}$$.
  * Normally, you'd say $$x$$ cannot be 3.
  * But notice that $$(x-3)$$ is on top and bottom. They cancel!
  * The graph will look exactly like the line $$y = x+2$$, but with an empty circle (a hole) at the point where $$x=3$$

#### Logarithmic & Exponential functions

<p align="center"><span class="math">f(x) = b^x</span></p>

* $$b$$ (Base): A constant number greater than 0 (and not 1).
* $$x$$ (Exponent): The variable (the input).

Unlike a linear function ($$2x$$) which grows at a steady pace, an exponential function ($$2^x$$) doubles every time $$x$$ increases by 1. This leads to very rapid growth.

Growth vs. Decay:

* If $$b > 1$$, it’s Exponential Growth (e.g., population growth).
* If $$0 < b < 1$$, it’s Exponential Decay (e.g., radioactive decay).

| Exponential (2^x=y)                     | Logarithmic (log2​(y)=x)                |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| If $$x=3$$, then $$y=8$$ (3, 8)         | If $$y=8$$, then $$x=3$$ (8, 3)         |
| If $$x=0$$, then $$y=1$$ (0, 1)         | If $$y=1$$, then $$x=0$$ (1, 0)         |
| If $$x=-2$$, then $$y=0.25$$ (-2, 0.25) | If $$y=0.25$$, then $$x=-2$$ (0.25, -2) |

***

We use logarithms when we deal with values that grow very quickly (exponentially) but we want to understand them on a scale that is easier to manage.

<p align="center"><span class="math">f(x) = \log_b(x)</span></p>

Where:

* $$b$$ (Base): Must be greater than 0 and not equal to 1.
* $$x$$ (Argument): The number you are finding the log of (must be positive).
* $$f(x)$$: The exponent needed to reach $$x$$ from base $$b$$

When numbers range from 1 to 1,000,000,000, a standard graph is hard to read. A logarithmic scale turns that into a scale of 0 to 9.

***

**Log-to-Exponential Conversion**

<p align="center"><span class="math">\log_b(x) = y \quad \longleftrightarrow \quad b^y = x</span></p>

<p align="center"><span class="math">\log_b(x) = \frac{\log_k(x)}{\log_k(b)}</span></p>

$$2^4 = 16$$, then $$y = 4$$. So, $$\log_2(16) = 4$$.

<p align="center"><span class="math">10^y = 0</span></p>

There is no such power. As $$y$$ gets smaller and smaller (like $$-100, -1000, \dots$$), $$10^y$$ gets closer and closer to zero ($$0.0000001\dots$$), but it never actually reaches it. This is why the graph of a logarithm has a vertical asymptote at $$x = 0$$. Its also the same for negative number

1. The Identity Rule: $$\log_b(b^x) = x$$. (The log and the base "cancel" each other out).
2. The Inverse Identity: $$b^{\log_b(x)} = x$$. (The base and the log power "cancel" each other out).

**Natural Logarithm**, $$\ln(x)$$, a logarithm with a very special base: the mathematical constant $$e$$ (approximately 2.71828)

* The "Cancel" Rules: $$\ln(e^x) = x$$ and $$e^{\ln(x)} = x$$. (They undo each other).
* The Reference Points: $$\ln(1) = 0$$ (because $$e^0 = 1$$) and $$\ln(e) = 1$$ (because $$e^1 = e$$).

***

$$f(g(x))$$ is called a composite function

the output of $$g(x)$$ becomes the input for $$f(x)$$

***

**Circle Equation**

$$(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$$

every point $$(x, y)$$ that lies on the edge of a specific circle

$$(h, k)$$: These are the coordinates of the Center of the circle.

* $$h$$ is the x-coordinate (left/right).
* $$k$$ is the y-coordinate (up/down).

$$r$$: This is the Radius (the distance from the center to the edge).

* Note: In the equation, the radius is squared ($$r^2$$).

$$(x, y)$$: These represent any point on the boundary of the circle.

If a circle is centered at $$(0, 0)$$ with a radius of $$5$$:

* $$(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 5^2$$
* $$x^2 + y^2 = 25$$

***

**Inverse Functions**

The $$-1$$ in $$f^{-1}(x)$$ is not an exponent. It doesn't mean $$\frac{1}{f(x)}$$. It is simply a special symbol used to label the inverse

Find the inverse of $$f(x) = 2x + 3$$

1.  Replace $$f(x)$$ with $$y$$

    $$y = 2x + 3$$
2.  Swap $$x$$ and $$y$$

    $$x = 2y + 3$$
3.  Solve for the new $$y$$

    $$x - 3 = 2y$$\
    $$\frac{x - 3}{2} = y$$
4.  Replace $$y$$ with $$f^{-1}(x)$$

    $$f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}$$
