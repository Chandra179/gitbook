#### Linear Functions (Graphing)

Slope-intercept form ($$y=mx+b$$)

&#x20;$$y=3x+5$$ interpretation and the slope formula $$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$.

#### Systems of Equations

Substitution and Elimination methods.

$$y=3x, x+y=16$$ (Substitution)&#x20;

$$x+y=10, x-y=2$$ (Elimination).

#### Exponents and Radicals

Understanding the rules of "repeated multiplication."

* Product rule, Power rule, and Quotient rule.
* $$x^4 \cdot x^5 = x^9$$ and $$\sqrt{x+2}=5$$.

#### Polynomials and Factoring

Factoring trinomials and recognizing the "Difference of Squares."

$$(x+4)(x+5)$$ and $$(x-7)(x+7)$$.

#### Quadratic Functions

Solving for $$x$$ when the variable is squared, using square roots, and the Quadratic Formula.

$$x^2=64$$ and $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$.

discriminant ($$D$$) is the formula found under the square root in the quadratic formula:

$$D = b^2 - 4ac$$

$$6x^2 + 11x - 10 = 0$$

* $$a = 6$$, $$b = 11$$, and $$c = -10$$.
* $$D = (11)^2 - 4(6)(-10)$$
* $$D = 121 + 240 = \mathbf{361}$$

#### **Complex & imaginary number**

$$a + bi$$

* $$i = \sqrt{-1}$$
* $$i^2 = -1$$
* $$x = \sqrt{-9} \rightarrow \sqrt{9} \cdot \sqrt{-1} \rightarrow \mathbf{3i}$$

**The Cycle of** $$i$$

One of the most unique things about $$i$$ is that it repeats in a four-step cycle when you raise it to higher powers.&#x20;

* $$i^1 = i$$
* $$i^2 = -1$$
* $$i^3 = -i$$
* $$i^4 = 1$$ (The cycle then restarts: $$i^5$$ is the same as $$i^1$$)

**Multiplication (FOIL)**

$$(2 + i)(3 + i)$$

$$6 + 5i + i^2$$

$$6 + 5i - 1 = \mathbf{5 + 5i}$$

#### **Exponential**

&#x20;$$y = ab^x$$

* $$a$$ (The Initial Value): This is where you start when $$x = 0$$. On a graph, this is your y-intercept.
* $$b$$ (The Base/Multiplier): This determines how fast the function grows or shrinks. It cannot be 1 (because $$1^x$$ never changes) and it must be positive.
* $$x$$ (The Exponent): Unlike linear math where $$x$$ is on the ground ($$3x$$), here $$x$$ is in the "attic." This means the variable controls how many times you multiply.

#### **General Transformation**&#x20;

**General transformation** is used to describe how a "parent" graph is moved, stretched, or flipped on a coordinate plane. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkP1LJR2PyM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkP1LJR2PyM)

$$f(x) = a \cdot b^{x-h} + k$$

The **Vertical** Shift ($$k$$)

* The value of $$k$$ controls the Horizontal Asymptote (the invisible floor).&#x20;
* If $$k$$ is positive ($$+3$$): The entire graph slides up 3 units. Your "floor" moves from $$y=0$$ to $$y=3$$.
* If $$k$$ is negative ($$-5$$): The entire graph slides down 5 units. Your "floor" is now at $$y=-5$$.

The **Horizontal** $$h$$ value sits in the exponent with $$x$$. This transformation moves the graph in the opposite direction of the sign you see.

* If you see $$(x - 3)$$: The graph moves Right 3 units.
* If you see $$(x + 2)$$: The graph moves Left 2 units.
* Why is it backward? To get the same output ($$y$$) as the original graph, you now have to use an $$x$$ value that is 3 units larger to "cancel out" the $$-3$$.

The **Vertical Stretch/Compression** $$a$$ value (the number in front) acts like you are grabbing the graph and pulling it taller or squishing it flatter.

* If $$|a| > 1$$: The graph gets "steep" faster (Vertical Stretch).
* If $$0 < |a| < 1$$: The graph looks flatter (Vertical Compression).
* If $$a$$ is negative ($$-a$$): The graph flips over the x-axis. Instead of exploding upward, it explodes downward.

$$f(x) = 2^{x-3} + 1$$:

1. Identify $$k$$: The asymptote is at $$y = 1$$. Draw a dashed line there first.
2. Identify $$h$$: The graph is moved Right 3.
3.  Find Y-Intercept: Plug in $$x = 0$$ to find exactly where it hits the y-axis.

    $$f(0) = 2^{0-3} + 1 = 2^{-3} + 1 = \frac{1}{8} + 1 = 1.125$$



$$x^3$$ (cubics), $$x^4$$ (quartics)



**Logarithms**: $$10^2 = 100$$, then $$\log_{10}(100) = 2$$

**Rational**: $$x$$ is in the denominator ($$\frac{1}{x}$$)

**Radical**: $$x$$ is under a square root ($$\sqrt{x}$$). These graphs have a specific starting point and curve off in one direction.

**Sine, Cosine, and Tangent** as repeating waves (Periodic Functions).
