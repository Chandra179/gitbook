# Quadratic Equation

Quadratic equations are essential for modeling paths, areas, and optimization problems. They are defined by the standard form $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$, where $$x$$ is the unknown, and $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ are known coefficients.

#### Factoring&#x20;

Factoring is the easiest method, but it only works quickly when the answers ($$x$$ solutions) are simple integers or easy fractions. In real-world problems, the answers are rarely that neat.

| **Equation** | **x2+5x+6=0**                          | **x2+4x−7=0**                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Solutions    | $$x = -2$$ and $$x = -3$$              | $$x = -2 + \sqrt{11}$$ and $$x = -2 - \sqrt{11}$$ |
| Factoring?   | Yes (Factors are easy: $$(x+2)(x+3)$$) | No (The solutions involve a messy $$\sqrt{11}$$)  |

If you tried to factor $$x^2 + 4x - 7 = 0$$, you would spend forever looking for two integers that multiply to $$-7$$ and add to $$4$$. They don't exist!

#### Completing Square

$$3x^2 + 5x - 4 = 0$$.

To start, you must divide everything by $$a=3$$

$$x^2 + \frac{5}{3}x - \frac{4}{3} = 0$$

Then, to complete the square, you need to add $$(\frac{b}{2})^2$$

$$\left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{3}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{36}$$

Working with those fractions is complex and prone to error.

#### Quadratic Formula

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

With the formula, you just plug in $$a=3$$, $$b=5$$, and $$c=-4$$ directly, avoiding all the complicated steps:

$$x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4(3)(-4)}}{2(3)}$$
