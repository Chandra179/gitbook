### Linear Equation

its always a straight line, so the of degree power (exponent) is 1

* $$y = mx + b$$
* $$ax + by = c$$

### Non-Linear Equation

the exponent is greater than 1

* $$y = 3x^2 - 4x + 1$$
* $$x^3 + y = 7$$

### Quadratic Equation

Quadratic equations are essential for modeling paths, areas, and optimization problems. They are defined by the standard form $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$, where $$x$$ is the unknown, and $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ are known coefficients.

#### Completing Square

$$3x^2 + 5x - 4 = 0$$.

To start, you must divide everything by $$a=3$$

$$x^2 + \frac{5}{3}x - \frac{4}{3} = 0$$

Then, to complete the square, you need to add $$(\frac{b}{2})^2$$

$$\left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{3}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{36}$$

Working with those fractions is complex and prone to error.

#### Quadratic Formula

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

With the formula, you just plug in $$a=3$$, $$b=5$$, and $$c=-4$$ directly, avoiding all the complicated steps:

$$x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4(3)(-4)}}{2(3)}$$
