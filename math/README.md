# Math



* **Pre-Algebra**: Mastery of fractions, decimals, negative numbers, and the order of operations (PEMDAS).
* **Algebra 1 & 2**: Solving for $$x$$, factoring polynomials, exponents, logarithms, and understanding functions ($$f(x)$$).
* **Geometry & Trigonometry**: Shapes, spatial logic, the unit circle, and sine/cosine functions.
* **Pre-Calculus**: Combining algebra and trig to handle limits and prepare for the study of change.
* **Calculus 1 (Differential)**: Understanding the derivative (the slope of a curve).
* **Discrete Mathematics**: Logic, set theory, and graph theory. This can be started anytime after Algebra 2 and is the "math of computer logic."
* **Linear Algebra**: Matrices and vectors. This is the most important math for AI data representation; start this after Calculus 1.
* **Calculus 2 (Integral)**: Accumulating quantities (area under a curve) and infinite series.
* **Calculus 3 (Multivariable)**: Taking derivatives and integrals with many variables at once. This combines with Linear Algebra for AI optimization.
* **Probability & Statistics**: Using Calculus and Set Theory to model uncertainty and data distributions.
* **Specialized Master's Math**: Numerical Methods (math for computers), Information Theory (data compression), and Optimization Theory (complex decision making).
* **Mathematical Proofs**: The practice of proving why math rules work, usually integrated into Discrete Math and Linear Algebra courses.
