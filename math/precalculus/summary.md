# Summary

### Global Properties

_These properties apply to all the function families listed (Linear, Quadratic, Polynomial, and Rational). They are the "universal" characteristics used to analyze any graph._

* Horizontal & Vertical Shifts
* Vertical Stretch & Shrink
* Reflections (x-axis and y-axis)
* Domain & Range
* Continuity
* End Behavior
* Inverse: The "undoing" function; only exists if the function is One-to-One.
* Average rate of change

***

### Linear Functions

* Slope (Rate of Change): The constant steepness of the line.
* Monotonicity: Always strictly increasing or strictly decreasing (unless the slope is zero).

***

### Quadratic Functions

* Vertex (Global Max/Min): The absolute highest or lowest point.
* Axis of Symmetry: The vertical line $$x = h$$ that splits the parabola perfectly in half.
* Discriminant: The $$b^2 - 4ac$$ test to determine the nature of the roots.
* Complex Zeros: Specific focus on $$i$$ when the parabola doesn't touch the x-axis.
* Concavity: Always staying either "up" or "down" for the entire graph.
* Turning Points: Exactly one turning point (the vertex).

***

### Polynomial Functions

* Degree: The highest exponent, which determines the overall "shape."
* Leading Coefficient: Works with the degree to dictate End Behavior.
* Multiplicity: How many times a zero repeats (affects if the graph crosses or bounces).
* Inflection Points: Where the graph changes from concave up to concave down.
* Complex Zeros (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra): The rule that a degree $$n$$ polynomial has exactly $$n$$ complex roots.
* Turning Points: Can have multiple (up to $$n-1$$).

***

### Rational Functions

* Vertical Asymptotes: Lines the graph approaches but never touches due to division by zero.
* Horizontal Asymptotes: Describes long-term behavior as $$ $x \to \infty$ $$.
* Slant (Oblique) Asymptotes: Occur when the numerator degree is higher than the denominator.
* Holes (Removable Discontinuities): Occur when factors cancel out.
* Domain Restrictions: Specifically caused by zeros in the denominator.
* Branches: The separate "curves" created by asymptotes.
