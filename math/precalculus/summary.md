# Summary

### **Global Analytical Properties**

_These are the universal lenses used to analyze any graph. While every function is checked for these, the results (like "End Behavior") look different depending on the family._

* Transformations: Horizontal/Vertical shifts, Vertical stretch/shrink, and Reflections ($$x$$ and $$y$$ axis).
* Domain & Range: The set of all possible inputs ($$x$$) and outputs ($$y$$).
* Intercepts: The points where the graph crosses the $$x$$-axis (roots/zeros) and $$y$$-axis.
* Rate of Change: Analyzed as a constant (Slope) or variable (Derivative).
* Inverses: The "undoing" function; requires a One-to-One relationship (often requiring Domain Restriction for Quadratics and Trig).
* Continuity & Discontinuity: Analyzing if the graph is a single unbroken curve or has holes/breaks.
* Symmetry: Checking if a function is Even ($$y$$-axis symmetry) or Odd (origin symmetry).
* Inequalities: Solving for intervals where $$f(x) > 0$$, $$f(x) < 0$$, or other relational conditions.
* Composition of Functions: Combining functions as $$f(g(x))$$; the output of one becomes the input of another.

### **Linear Functions**

* Slope (Rate of Change): The constant steepness; the "m" in $$y = mx + b$$.
* Monotonicity: The function is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing for its entire domain.
* $$x$$ and $$y$$ Intercepts: The single points where the line crosses the axes.
* Parallel Lines: Share the same slope ($$m_1 = m_2$$).
* Perpendicular Lines: Slopes are negative reciprocals ($$m_1 m_2 = -1$$).
* Point-Slope Form: $$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$ for writing equations from a point and slope.

***

### **Quadratic Functions**

* Vertex (Global Max/Min): The absolute highest or lowest point of the parabola.
* Axis of Symmetry: The vertical line $$x = h$$ that splits the graph perfectly in half.
* Concavity: The graph is always either "concave up" (cup) or "concave down" (frown).
* Discriminant: Using $$b^2 - 4ac$$ to predict the number and type of roots (Real vs. Complex).
* Turning Points: Always has exactly one turning point.
* Factoring Methods: Greatest Common Factor (GCF), Difference of Squares ($$a^2 - b^2$$), Factor by Grouping, Trinomial Factoring.
* Completing the Square: Method to convert $$ax^2 + bx + c$$ to vertex form $$a(x-h)^2 + k$$.
* Product Formulas: Special patterns including $$(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$, $$(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$$, and $$(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2$$.
* Quadratic Formula: $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$ for finding roots.
* Vertex Form: $$y = a(x-h)^2 + k$$ for identifying the vertex $$(h, k)$$ directly.

***

### **Polynomial Functions**

* Degree ($$n$$): The highest exponent, which dictates the maximum number of roots and turning points.
* End Behavior: Determined by the Degree and Leading Coefficient (e.g., "up-up" or "down-up").
* Multiplicity: Determines if the graph crosses the x-axis (odd multiplicity) or bounces (even multiplicity).
* Turning Points: Can have up to $$n-1$$ turning points.
* Inflection Points: Specific locations where the concavity switches from "up" to "down."
* Polynomial Division: Long Division and Synthetic Division for dividing polynomials.
* Factor Theorem: $$(x-c)$$ is a factor of $$P(x)$$ if and only if $$P(c) = 0$$.
* Remainder Theorem: When $$P(x)$$ is divided by $$(x-c)$$, the remainder is $$P(c)$$.
* Complex Roots: When the discriminant is negative, roots occur in conjugate pairs ($$a + bi$$ and $$a - bi$$).
* Rational Root Theorem: Possible rational zeros are of the form $$\frac{p}{q}$$ where $$p$$ divides the constant term and $$q$$ divides the leading coefficient.

***

### **Rational Functions**

* Vertical Asymptotes: "Invisible walls" caused by values that make the denominator zero.
* Horizontal/Slant Asymptotes: Describes the "End Behavior" as $$x \to \infty$$.
* Holes (Removable Discontinuities): Occur when a factor in the numerator and denominator cancels out.
* Branches: The separate, disconnected curves created by asymptotes.
* Domain Restrictions: Values where $$Q(x) = 0$$ make the function undefined and must be excluded.
* Simplifying Rational Expressions: Canceling common factors between numerator and denominator (while noting excluded values).

***

### **Exponential Functions**

* Standard Form: $$f(x) = a \cdot b^x$$ where $$a$$ is the initial value and $$b$$ is the base.

* Growth/Decay Rate Form: $$f(t) = a(1 \pm r)^t$$ where $$r$$ is the percentage rate.
* Natural Exponential: $$f(x) = e^x$$ where $$e \approx 2.71828$$ (Euler's number).
* Horizontal Asymptote: Typically $$y = 0$$ (the x-axis) for standard exponential functions.
* Domain & Range: Domain is all real numbers $$(-\infty, \infty)$$; Range is $$(0, \infty)$$ for standard form.
* Applications: Compound interest, population growth, radioactive decay.
* One-to-One Property: Always passes the Horizontal Line Test; has an inverse (logarithmic function).
