# Summary

#### Global Analytical Properties

_These are the universal lenses used to analyze any graph. While every function is checked for these, the results (like "End Behavior") look different depending on the family._

* Transformations: Horizontal/Vertical shifts, Vertical stretch/shrink, and Reflections ($$x$$ and $$y$$ axis).
* Domain & Range: The set of all possible inputs ($$x$$) and outputs ($$y$$).
* Rate of Change: Analyzed as a constant (Slope) or variable (Derivative).
* Inverses: The "undoing" function; requires a One-to-One relationship (often requiring Domain Restriction for Quadratics and Trig).
* Continuity & Discontinuity: Analyzing if the graph is a single unbroken curve or has holes/breaks.
* Symmetry: Checking if a function is Even ($$y$$-axis symmetry) or Odd (origin symmetry).

***

#### Linear Functions

* Slope (Rate of Change): The constant steepness; the "m" in $$y = mx + b$$.
* Monotonicity: The function is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing for its entire domain.
* $$x$$ and $$y$$ Intercepts: The single points where the line crosses the axes.

***

#### Quadratic Functions

* Vertex (Global Max/Min): The absolute highest or lowest point of the parabola.
* Axis of Symmetry: The vertical line $$x = h$$ that splits the graph perfectly in half.
* Concavity: The graph is always either "concave up" (cup) or "concave down" (frown).
* Discriminant: Using $$b^2 - 4ac$$ to predict the number and type of roots (Real vs. Complex).
* Turning Points: Always has exactly one turning point.

***

#### Polynomial Functions

* Degree ($$ $n$ $$): The highest exponent, which dictates the maximum number of roots and turning points.
* End Behavior: Determined by the Degree and Leading Coefficient (e.g., "up-up" or "down-up").
* Multiplicity: Determines if the graph crosses the x-axis (odd multiplicity) or bounces (even multiplicity).
* Turning Points: Can have up to $$ $n-1$ $$ turning points.
* Inflection Points: Specific locations where the concavity switches from "up" to "down."

***

#### Rational Functions

* Vertical Asymptotes: "Invisible walls" caused by values that make the denominator zero.
* Horizontal/Slant Asymptotes: Describes the "End Behavior" as $$ $x \to \infty$ $$.
* Holes (Removable Discontinuities): Occur when a factor in the numerator and denominator cancels out.
* Branches: The separate, disconnected curves created by asymptotes.

***

#### Trigonometric Functions

* Periodicity: The repeating nature of the graph; the distance required to complete one full cycle.
* Amplitude: The vertical "reach" of the wave; the distance from the midline to the peak.
* Phase Shift: The trigonometric term for a horizontal shift.
* Midline (Vertical Shift): The horizontal center line ($$y=d$$) that the wave oscillates around.
* Domain Restrictions: Essential for defining Inverse Trig functions (Arccosine, Arcsine, etc.).
* Asymptotes: Periodic vertical breaks found in $$\tan, \cot, \sec,$$ and $$\csc$$.
* Identities: Mathematical "exchange rates" (like $$\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$$) used to simplify complex waves.
