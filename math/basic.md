**Real number**&#x20;

there is no real number that, when multiplied by itself, results in a negative number. The expression $$\sqrt{-9}$$ asks the question: What real number, when multiplied by itself (squared), equals $$-9$$?

Let's test all possibilities for a Real Number $$x$$:

1.  If $$x$$ is Positive (e.g., 3)

    $$x \times x = 3 \times 3 = 9$$ (Result is Positive)
2.  If $$x$$ is Negative (e.g., $$-3$$)

    $$x \times x = (-3) \times (-3) = 9$$ (Result is Positive)
3.  If $$x$$ is Zero (i.e., $$0$$)

    $$x \times x = 0 \times 0 = 0$$ (Result is Zero)

Since there is no way to multiply a real number by itself and get a negative result like $$-9$$, the answer to $$\sqrt{-9}$$ cannot be found on the Real Number Line.

**Rational number** number that can be represent as ratio $$\mathbf{p/q}$$

**Natural number** positive number

**Irrational number** Any real number that cannot be written as a ratio of two integers ($$p/q$$)

**Variables** (like $$x$$ or $$y$$)

**Coefficients** (the number multiplying the variable, like the 3 in $$3x^2$$)

**Exponents** (the power, like the 2 in $$x^2$$)

* $$x^a \cdot x^b = x^{a+b}$$
* $$\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}$$
* $$(x^a)^b = x^{ab}$$

**Terms** (parts separated by addition/subtraction, like $$3x^2$$, $$-5x$$, and $$7$$)

**Constant** Term (the term with no variable, like 7)

**Distributive Property**

* &#x20;$$2x(x - 5) = 2x^2 - 10x$$
* &#x20;$$(x+3)(x-2) = x^2 + x - 6$$

**Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**

* GCF of $$10x^4 - 15x^3 + 5x^2$$.
* Coefficients (10, 15, 5): The largest number that divides all three is $$\mathbf{5}$$.
* Variable ($$x^4, x^3, x^2$$): The lowest power is $$\mathbf{x^2}$$.
* GCF: $$5x^2$$

**Special Products**

| Product Type                          | Multiplication Formula (Multiplying) | Factoring Formula (Factoring)   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Difference of Squares                 | $$(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$$       | $$a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$$  |
| Perfect Square Trinomial (Sum)        | $$(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$      | $$a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2$$ |
| Perfect Square Trinomial (Difference) | $$(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$$      | $$a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2$$ |

* Difference of Squares: $$4x^2 - 9 = (2x)^2 - 3^2 = (2x - 3)(2x + 3)$$
* Perfect Square Trinomial: $$x^2 - 10x + 25 = (x)^2 - 2(x)(5) + 5^2 = (x - 5)^2$$
