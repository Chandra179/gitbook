#### **Number**

**Real number**

there is no real number that, when multiplied by itself, results in a negative number. The expression $$\sqrt{-9}$$ asks the question: What real number, when multiplied by itself (squared), equals $$-9$$?

Let's test all possibilities for a Real Number $$x$$:

1.  If $$x$$ is Positive (e.g., 3)

    $$x \times x = 3 \times 3 = 9$$ (Result is Positive)
2.  If $$x$$ is Negative (e.g., $$-3$$)

    $$x \times x = (-3) \times (-3) = 9$$ (Result is Positive)
3.  If $$x$$ is Zero (i.e., $$0$$)

    $$x \times x = 0 \times 0 = 0$$ (Result is Zero)

Since there is no way to multiply a real number by itself and get a negative result like $$-9$$, the answer to $$\sqrt{-9}$$ cannot be found on the Real Number Line.

**Natural number** positive number

**Irrational number** Any real number that cannot be written as a ratio of two integers ($$p/q$$) like $$\mathbf{\sqrt{2}}$$, $$\mathbf{\pi}$$, $$\mathbf{e}$$ (Euler's number)

**Variables** (like $$x$$ or $$y$$)

**Coefficients** (the number multiplying the variable, like the 3 in $$3x^2$$)

**Terms** (parts separated by addition/subtraction, like $$3x^2$$, $$-5x$$, and $$7$$)

**Constant** Term (the term with no variable, like 7)

**Modulus** $$a = (n \times q) + r$$

* $$1 = (10 \times 0) + r$$, r =1
* $$99 = (100 \times 0) + r$$, r=99

***

#### **Distributive Property**

* $$a(b + c) = ab + ac$$
* $$a(b - c) = ab - ac$$
* $$(a + b)(x + y) = \underbrace{a(x + y)}_{\text{Distribute } a} + \underbrace{b(x + y)}_{\text{Distribute } b}$$

Imagine you are buying items for a school trip:

* First Group ($$\mathbf{a+b}$$): The number of people going.
  * $$a = 10$$ students.
  * $$b = 2$$ teachers.
  * $$\mathbf{a+b = 12}$$ people.
* Second Group ($$\mathbf{x+y}$$): The cost per person.
  * $$x = \$5$$ for lunch.
  * $$y = \$3$$ for a drink/snack.
  * $$\mathbf{x+y = \$8}$$ total cost per person.

The total cost is the product of the two: $$(10 + 2)(5 + 3)$$

|                   | Lunch ($5)                      | Snack ($3)                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Students ($$10$$) | $$10 \times 5 = \mathbf{\$50}$$ | $$10 \times 3 = \mathbf{\$30}$$ |
| Teachers ($$2$$)  | $$2 \times 5 = \mathbf{\$10}$$  | $$2 \times 3 = \mathbf{\$6}$$   |

Total Cost = $$\$50 + \$30 + \$10 + \$6 = \mathbf{\$96}$$

#### **Associative Property**

* $$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$
* $$(ab) c = a (bc)$$

#### **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**

* GCF of $$10x^4 - 15x^3 + 5x^2$$.
* Coefficients (10, 15, 5): The largest number that divides all three is $$\mathbf{5}$$.
* Variable ($$x^4, x^3, x^2$$): The lowest power is $$\mathbf{x^2}$$.
* GCF: $$5x^2$$

A product of identical numbers is usually written in exponential notation

* $$2^5 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 32$$
* $$\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 = \frac{1^5}{2^5}$$
* $$\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^6 = \frac{2^6}{5^6}$$
* $$x^a \cdot x^b = x^{a+b}$$
* $$\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}$$
* $$\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}$$
* $$(x^a)^b = x^{ab}$$

#### **Radicals**

The number inside the root _must_ be a result of something being raised to the power of $$n$$

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/prop_of_roots.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The expression to simplify is $$\sqrt[4]{81x^8y^4}$$.

$$\sqrt[4]{81x^8y^4} = \sqrt[4]{81}\sqrt[4]{x^8}\sqrt[4]{y^4}$$ This step uses Property 1 ($$\sqrt[n]{ab} = \sqrt[n]{a} \cdot \sqrt[n]{b}$$) to separate the single radical into a product of three individual radicals.

<p align="center"><span class="math">= 3\sqrt[4]{(x^2)^4}|y|</span></p>

This step simplifies each of the three terms separately:

1. Simplifying $$\sqrt[4]{81}$$ Since $$3^4 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$$, the fourth root of 81 is 3.
2. Simplifying $$\sqrt[4]{x^8}$$:
   * This is rewritten by expressing $$x^8$$ as a power of 4: $$x^8 = (x^2)^4$$.
   * The term becomes $$\sqrt[4]{(x^2)^4}$$.
3. Simplifying $$\sqrt[4]{y^4}$$
   * This uses Property 5 ($$\sqrt[n]{a^n} = |a|$$, if $$n$$ is even). Since $$n=4$$ (even), the fourth root of $$y^4$$ must be the absolute value of $$y$$, or $$|y|$$.

<p align="center"><span class="math">= 3x^2|y|</span></p>

Simplifying $$\sqrt[4]{(x^2)^4}$$

* This uses Property 5 again. The $$n$$th root cancels the $$n$$th power, and since $$n=4$$ is even, we use the absolute value: $$\sqrt[4]{(x^2)^4} = |x^2|$$.
* However, because any real number squared ($$x^2$$) is always non-negative, the absolute value signs are not necessary. So, $$|x^2|$$ simplifies to just $$x^2$$.

The final simplified expression is $$3x^2|y|$$.

The key takeaway is that the absolute value signs are essential when simplifying an even root of a variable raised to the same power (like $$\sqrt[4]{y^4}$$), unless you are certain the result is non-negative (like in the case of $$x^2$$).

#### Product Formulas

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/product_formulas.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

$$(3x + 4)(3x - 4) = (3x)^2 - (4)^2$$

$$(3x + 4)(3x - 4) = 9x^2 - 16$$

$$(2y + 5)^2 = (2y)^2 + 2(2y)(5) + (5)^2$$

$$(2y + 5)^2 = 4y^2 + 20y + 25$$

$$(z - 6)^2 = (z)^2 - 2(z)(6) + (6)^2$$

$$(z - 6)^2 = z^2 - 12z + 36$$

$$(x + 2)^3 = (x)^3 + 3(x)^2(2) + 3(x)(2)^2 + (2)^3$$

$$(x + 2)^3 = x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8$$

$$(2m - 1)^3 = (2m)^3 - 3(2m)^2(1) + 3(2m)(1)^2 - (1)^3$$

$$(2m - 1)^3 = 8m^3 - 3(4m^2)(1) + 3(2m)(1) - 1$$

$$(2m - 1)^3 = 8m^3 - 12m^2 + 6m - 1$$

#### Rational Expressions

A rational expression is simply a fraction (a ratio) where both the numerator (top) and the denominator (bottom) are polynomials. It is also sometimes referred to as an algebraic fraction.

$$\frac{x^2 + 5x + 6}{x^2 - 4} = \frac{(x + 2)(x + 3)}{(x - 2)(x + 2)}$$\
\
$$\frac{\cancel{(x + 2)}(x + 3)}{(x - 2)\cancel{(x + 2)}} = \frac{x + 3}{x - 2}$$

A rational expression can be written in the form $$\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$, where $$P(x)$$ and $$Q(x)$$ are polynomials.

denominator, $$Q(x)$$, cannot be equal to zero. Division by zero is undefined
