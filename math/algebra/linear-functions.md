# Linear Functions

### **Slope**

When you have two points $$(x_1, y_1)$$ and $$(x_2, y_2)$$ and need to find the steepness ($$m$$).

$$slope(m) = rise/run$$

$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

* $$(2, 3)$$ and $$(5, 9)$$
* $$m = \frac{9 - 3}{5 - 2}$$

### **Slope-Intercept**

$$y=mx+b$$

When you know the slope and where the line hits the y-axis (the y-intercept), or when you need to graph a line quickly.

$$m = -\frac{1}{2}$$ and $$b = 4$$

* $$y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 4$$
* $$y = -\frac{1}{2}(10) + 4 \rightarrow y = -5 + 4$$.
* $$y = -1$$

### **Point-Slope**

$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$

Use it when you have a slope and any point (not necessarily the y-intercept)

Write the equation of a line that has a slope of $$3$$ and passes through the point $$(4, -1)$$.

* Identify $$m = 3$$, $$x_1 = 4$$, and $$y_1 = -1$$.
* $$y - (-1) = 3(x - 4)$$
* $$y + 1 = 3(x - 4)$$
* $$y + 1 = 3(x - 4)$$

### **Standard Form**

$$Ax + By = C$$. used it to find intercepts easily or to solve systems of equations using the "Elimination"

Find the x-intercept and y-intercept for the line $$3x + 4y = 12$$.

* To find the x-intercept, set $$y=0$$ ⇒ $$3x + 4(0) = 12 \rightarrow 3x = 12 \rightarrow x = 4$$.
* To find the y-intercept, set $$x=0$$ ⇒ $$3(0) + 4y = 12 \rightarrow 4y = 12 \rightarrow y = 3$$.
* The line hits the x-axis at $$(4, 0)$$ and the y-axis at $$(0, 3)$$.

### Linear Inequalities

If you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you must flip the direction of the inequality sign.

* $$-2x < 10$$, then $$x > -5$$.

Adding or subtracting numbers does not change the sign, even if the numbers are negative.

### Matrix

*   Quantity Matrix ($$Q$$): Rows = Locations, Columns = Items

    $$Q = \begin{bmatrix} 50 & 80 \\ 30 & 100 \end{bmatrix}$$
*   Price Matrix ($$P$$): A column matrix of prices

    $$P = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$$
* ($$Q \times P$$):
  * Downtown: $$(50 \times 3) + (80 \times 2) = 150 + 160 = \$310$$
  * Uptown: $$(30 \times 3) + (100 \times 2) = 90 + 200 = \$290$$
