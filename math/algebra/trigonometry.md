Opposite = height\
Hypotenuse = diagonal\
Adjacent = flat line\
$$(\theta)$$ = angle degrees

### Sine ($$\sin$$)

$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$$

* What it finds: The Height (Vertical).
* Use this when you know the Diagonal length and the angle.
* Real World Example: A kid is flying a kite. He let out 100 feet of string (Hypotenuse). The string is at a $$30^\circ$$ angle. How high is the kite?
* to find the Height, you move the Diagonal to the other side:
* $$\text{Height} = 100 \times \sin(30^\circ)$$
* $$100 \times 0.5 = \mathbf{50 \text{ feet high}}$$.

***

### Cosine ($$\cos$$)

$$\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$$

* What it finds: The Base (Horizontal/Flat line).
* Use this when you know the Diagonal length and want to know how far it travels along the ground.
* Real World Example: A 12-foot ladder is leaning against a wall at a $$60^\circ$$ angle from the ground. How far is the base of the ladder from the wall?
* $$\text{Distance} = 12 \times \cos(60^\circ)$$
* $$12 \times 0.5 = \mathbf{6 \text{ feet from the wall}}$$.

***

### Tangent ($$\tan$$)

$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$$

* What it finds: The Height (if you don't have the diagonal).
* Use this when you are standing on the ground and looking up at something tall.
* Real World Example: You are standing 50 feet away from a tree. You look at the top at a $$45^\circ$$ angle. How tall is the tree?
* $$\text{Height} = 50 \times \tan(45^\circ)$$
* $$50 \times 1 = \mathbf{50 \text{ feet tall}}$$.

***

### Cosecant ($$\csc$$)

$$\csc(\theta) = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Opposite}}$$ (The flip of Sine)

* What it finds: The Diagonal length.
* Use this when you know how high you need to go and want to find the diagonal path.
* Real World Example: You want to build a zip-line. The platform is 20 feet high. You want the line at a $$30^\circ$$ angle. How much cable do you need to buy?
* $$\text{Cable} = 20 \times \csc(30^\circ)$$ (Note: $$\csc$$ is $$1/0.5 = 2$$)
* $$20 \times 2 = \mathbf{40 \text{ feet of cable}}$$.

***

### Secant ($$\sec$$)

$$\sec(\theta) = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Adjacent}}$$ (The flip of Cosine)

* What it finds: The Diagonal length.
* Use this when you know the flat distance and need to find the diagonal.
* Real World Example: An architect is designing a bridge. The gap to cross is 100 feet wide. The support beam must be at a $$30^\circ$$ angle. How long is the beam?
* $$\text{Beam} = 100 \times \sec(30^\circ)$$
* $$100 \times 1.15 = \mathbf{115 \text{ feet long}}$$.

***

### Cotangent ($$\cot$$)

&#x20;$$\cot(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Opposite}}$$ (The flip of Tangent)

* What it finds: The Flat distance.
* Use this when you know the Height and want to find the ground distance.
* Real World Example: A lighthouse is 100 feet tall. It spots a boat at a $$10^\circ$$ angle from the top. How far away is the boat on the water?
* $$\text{Distance} = 100 \times \cot(10^\circ)$$
* The Answer: $$100 \times 5.67 = \mathbf{567 \text{ feet away}}$$.

### The Square Cut (The $$45^\circ$$ Angles)

Imagine a square where the sides are 1 unit long. We cut it diagonally to create a right triangle.

#### Use Pythagoras to find the Diagonal

* Base ($$a$$): 1
* Height ($$b$$): 1
* Diagonal ($$c$$): ?

$$1^2 + 1^2 = c^2$$

$$1 + 1 = c^2$$

$$c = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414$$

#### The $$45^\circ$$ Trig Results

* $$\sin(45^\circ)$$: $$\frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx \mathbf{0.707}$$
* $$\cos(45^\circ)$$: $$\frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx \mathbf{0.707}$$
* $$\tan(45^\circ)$$: $$\frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{1}{1} = \mathbf{1}$$
* $$\csc(45^\circ)$$: $$\frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Opposite}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{1} \approx \mathbf{1.414}$$
* $$\sec(45^\circ)$$: $$\frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{1} \approx \mathbf{1.414}$$
* $$\cot(45^\circ)$$: $$\frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Opposite}} = \frac{1}{1} = \mathbf{1}$$

### The Equilateral Cut (The $$30^\circ$$ and $$60^\circ$$ Angles)

Imagine a triangle where all sides are 2 units long. We chop it in half vertically.

#### Use Pythagoras to find the Vertical Height

* Base ($$a$$): 1 (since the 2-unit base was cut in half)
* Diagonal ($$c$$): 2 (the original side)
* Height ($$b$$): ?

$$1^2 + b^2 = 2^2$$

$$1 + b^2 = 4$$

$$b^2 = 3 \rightarrow b = \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732$$

#### The $$30^\circ$$ Results (Looking from the top corner)

* $$\sin(30^\circ)$$: $$\frac{1}{2} = \mathbf{0.5}$$
* $$\cos(30^\circ)$$: $$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx \mathbf{0.866}$$
* $$\tan(30^\circ)$$: $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \approx \mathbf{0.577}$$
* $$\csc(30^\circ)$$: $$\frac{2}{1} = \mathbf{2}$$
* $$\sec(30^\circ)$$: $$\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx \mathbf{1.155}$$
* $$\cot(30^\circ)$$: $$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{1} \approx \mathbf{1.732}$$

#### The $$60^\circ$$ Results (Looking from the bottom corner)

* $$\sin(60^\circ)$$: $$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx \mathbf{0.866}$$
* $$\cos(60^\circ)$$: $$\frac{1}{2} = \mathbf{0.5}$$
* $$\tan(60^\circ)$$: $$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{1} \approx \mathbf{1.732}$$
* $$\csc(60^\circ)$$: $$\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx \mathbf{1.155}$$
* $$\sec(60^\circ)$$: $$\frac{2}{1} = \mathbf{2}$$
* $$\cot(60^\circ)$$: $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \approx \mathbf{0.577}$$
