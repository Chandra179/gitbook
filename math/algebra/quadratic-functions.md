# Quadratic Functions

Solving for $$x$$ when the variable is squared, using square roots, and the Quadratic Formula.

$$x^2=64$$ and $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$.

discriminant ($$D$$) is the formula found under the square root in the quadratic formula:

$$D = b^2 - 4ac$$

$$6x^2 + 11x - 10 = 0$$

* $$a = 6$$, $$b = 11$$, and $$c = -10$$.
* $$D = (11)^2 - 4(6)(-10)$$
* $$D = 121 + 240 = \mathbf{361}$$

Completing the Square and Vertex Form: $$y = a(x-h)^2 + k$$
