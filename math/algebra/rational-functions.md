# Rational Functions

### Rational Functions

$$f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$

$$q(x) \neq 0$$ (the zero polynomial)

**Vertical Asymptote**

A vertical asymptote happens when the denominator is zero, and the problem cannot be fixed.

* You factor the function, and the factor in the bottom stays there. It doesn't cancel out.
* The graph "explodes" As you get closer to that $$x$$-value, the $$y$$-values shoot up to $$+\infty$$ or down to $$-\infty$$. It's like a wall the graph can never cross.
* $$f(x) = \frac{1}{x-3}$$. At $$x=3$$, the denominator is zero. There is no $$(x-3)$$ on top to cancel it, so $$x=3$$ is a Vertical Asymptote.

**Hole**

A hole (Removable Discontinuity) happens when the denominator is zero, but the problem is "canceled out" by the numerator.

* A factor appears in both the top and bottom. You can "cancel" them to simplify the function.
* The graph looks like a perfectly normal, smooth line or curve, but If you were drawing it with a pencil, you'd lift the pencil for one millisecond and then keep going.
* Example: $$f(x) = \frac{(x-3)(x+2)}{x-3}$$.
  * Normally, you'd say $$x$$ cannot be 3.
  * But notice that $$(x-3)$$ is on top and bottom. They cancel!
  * The graph will look exactly like the line $$y = x+2$$, but with an empty circle (a hole) at the point where $$x=3$$
