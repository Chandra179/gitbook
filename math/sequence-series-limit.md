# Sequence, Series, Limit

### Arithmetic

**Sequence**

Arithmetic math is based on addition. If you graph it, it always forms a perfectly straight line.

$$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$$

Variable Breakdown:

* $$a_n$$ (The Target): The value of the number at position $$n$$. (e.g., "What is the 100th number?")
* $$a_1$$ (The Start): The very first number in your list.
* $$n$$ (The Position): Which step you are on. We use $$(n-1)$$ because we don't add the difference to the first term; we only start adding it from the second term onward.
* $$d$$ (The Common Difference): The amount you add (or subtract) at every step.

You start a job at $50,000 ($$a_1$$). You get a guaranteed raise of $3,000 ($$d$$) every year. What is your salary in Year 10 ($$n$$)?

$$a_{10} = 50,000 + (10 - 1)3,000 = \mathbf{\$77,000}$$

**Series**

$$S_n = \frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}$$

Variable Breakdown:

* $$S_n$$: The "Sum." The total of all numbers from the 1st to the $$n$$-th.
* $$n/2$$: This represents the number of "pairs" you have.
* $$(a_1 + a_n)$$: The sum of the first and last term.

Practical Example: A theater has 20 rows. The 1st row has 30 seats ($$a_1$$), and the 20th row has 80 seats ($$a_{20}$$). How many total seats ($$S_{20}$$) are in the theater?

$$S_{20} = \frac{20(30 + 80)}{2} = 10 \times 110 = \mathbf{1,100 \text{ seats}}$$

### Geometric

Geometric math is based on multiplication. It starts slow but "explodes" or "vanishes" very quickly.

**Sequence**

$$a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$$

Variable Breakdown:

* $$a_1$$: The starting value.
* $$r$$ (Common Ratio): What you multiply by each time.
  * If $$r = 2$$, it doubles.
  * If $$r = 0.5$$, it cuts in half.
* $$n-1$$: The number of times the growth has happened.

A viral post starts with 10 shares ($$a_1$$). The number of shares triples ($$r=3$$) every hour. How many shares will occur in Hour 6 ($$n$$)?

$$a_6 = 10 \cdot 3^{(6-1)} = 10 \cdot 243 = \mathbf{2,430 \text{ shares}}$$

**Series**

$$S_n = a_1 \left( \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \right)$$

Variable Breakdown:

* $$r^n$$: The total growth factor over $$n$$ steps.
* $$1-r$$: The denominator that scales the sum correctly.

You save $100 this month. Every month you increase your savings by 10% ($$r=1.10$$). How much total have you saved after 4 months ($$n$$)?

$$S_4 = 100 \left( \frac{1 - 1.10^4}{1 - 1.10} \right) = 100 \times 4.641 = \mathbf{\$464.10}$$

**Infinite Geometric Series**

This is the "Limit" part of your heading. If a geometric sequence gets smaller and smaller ($$|r| < 1$$), the total sum doesn't go to infinity—it hits a "wall" or a Limit.

$$S_\infty = \frac{a_1}{1 - r}$$

Variable Breakdown:

* $$S_\infty$$: The value the sum approaches but never exceeds.
* $$1 - r$$: The "gap" remaining.

You drop a "Super-Ball" from a height of 10 feet ($$a_1$$). Each bounce reaches half ($$r=0.5$$) the height of the previous bounce. If it bounces forever, what is the total vertical distance it travels?

$$S_\infty = \frac{10}{1 - 0.5} = \frac{10}{0.5} = \mathbf{20 \text{ feet}}$$

## Binomial Theorem&#x20;

Binomial Theorem used to expand expressions that consist of two terms (a "binomial") raised to a high power. Instead of multiplying brackets manually for hours, this theorem provides a direct shortcut to the final answer.

$$(x + y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k$$

#### Breaking down the variables:

* $$x$$ and $$y$$: The two terms inside the parentheses.
* $$n$$: The exponent (the power you are raising the expression to).
* $$k$$: The term number you are currently calculating (it starts at 0 and goes up to $$n$$).
*   $$\binom{n}{k}$$: This is the Binomial Coefficient, often read as "$$n$$ choose $$k$$." It is calculated as:

    $$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
