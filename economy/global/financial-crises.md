## How banks work

Banks transform short-term deposits into long-term loans — **maturity transformation**.

Simplified balance sheet (10% reserve ratio):

| Assets | Liabilities |
|---|---|
| Reserves: \$10 | Deposits: \$100 |
| Loans: \$90 | |

Normally 1-2% of depositors show up daily. Reserves cover it.

**Vulnerability**: assets (loans) are illiquid, liabilities (deposits) are demandable. If a depositor believes others will run, running is rational — even if the bank is solvent.

## Diamond-Dybvig model (Nobel 2022)

Two equilibria:
1. **Good**: everyone waits → bank functions, depositors get full value
2. **Bad**: everyone runs → fire sales → bank insolvent → depositors lose

Deposit insurance eliminates equilibrium 2. Before FDIC (1933), runs were rational.

## 2008 Global Financial Crisis

### Shadow banking

By 2007, ~50% of lending was through **shadow banks** — no deposits, no deposit insurance, no Fed access:

| Institution | Funds source | Assets |
|---|---|---|
| Money market funds | Overnight repo | SIV commercial paper |
| SIVs | 30-90 day CP | Subprime MBS (long-term) |
| Investment banks | Overnight repo | MBS, CDOs |
| AIG | Insurance premiums | CDS on MBS |

**Repo** works like a deposit: "I lend \$100M overnight, you give me Treasuries as collateral." Rolled daily. If collateral value is doubted, lender raises **haircut** or refuses to roll.

### The trigger

- **2004-2006**: 5M subprime mortgages originated → packaged into MBS → CDOs → CDO-squared. Rating agencies gave AAA to toxic pools.
- **2006**: US house prices peak.
- **2007**: Delinquencies rise. BNP Paribas freezes redemptions (Aug 9 — first signal). Bear Stearns hedge funds fail.
- **Mar 2008**: Bear Stearns acquired by JPMorgan (Fed guarantees losses).

### September 2008 — everything breaks

| Date | Event | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Sept 7 | Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac taken over | Government backs housing |
| Sept 15 | Lehman Brothers Chapter 11 | No buyer, Fed refuses guarantee |
| Sept 16 | AIG bailout \$85B | Post-Lehman panic, CDS chain reaction |
| Sept 18-19 | Reserve Primary Fund "breaks the buck" | Money market fund held Lehman CP → investors redeem → systemic freeze. Treasury guarantees MMFs. SEC bans short-selling. |

### Why Lehman was catastrophic

Lehman held \$600B assets and was counterparty to everyone — derivatives, repo, swaps.

1. **Repo market froze**: lenders demanded Treasuries-only. Non-Treasury collateral unusable. Hedge funds couldn't fund → forced selling → crash.
2. **CDS chain**: AIG wrote \$440B in CDS on MBS. Lehman triggered margin calls AIG couldn't meet.
3. **CP market froze**: GE, Caterpillar couldn't roll commercial paper to fund payroll. Wall Street crisis → Main Street recession.

### The plumbing that saved the world

| Facility | What | When |
|---|---|---|
| PDCF | Fed lends directly to broker-dealers | Mar 2008 |
| TARP (\$700B) | Treasury buys toxic assets / injects capital | Oct 2008 |
| QE | Fed buys MBS and Treasuries → lowers long rates | Nov 2008 |
| Dollar swap lines | Fed gives dollars to ECB, BOE, BOJ | 2008-ongoing |

**Key insight**: 2008 was a **wholesale funding run** — not retail depositors, but institutional money (MMFs, repo, CP). Same logic as a bank run, no deposit insurance.

### Post-2008 regulation

| Rule | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Dodd-Frank** (2010) | Volcker Rule (no prop trading), enhanced supervision, stress tests |
| **Basel III** | Higher capital: CET1 ≥ 4.5% + 2.5% conservation buffer. LCR (30-day liquidity), NSFR (1-year stability). Leverage ratio ≥ 3% |
| **Resolution planning** | Living wills for too-big-to-fail banks |
| **Central clearing** | CCPs for derivatives — reduce counterparty risk |

## Great Depression (1929-1933)

- Oct 1929 crash: stocks -40% from peak.
- **1930-1933**: Four banking panics. 9,000 banks failed (40% of total).
- No deposit insurance. Runs were rational.
- **Fed did nothing** — even raised rates in 1931 to defend gold standard.
- Money supply fell 33%. Deflation ~10%/year.
- Friedman & Schwartz (1963): failure of the Fed to provide liquidity.

Lesson learned: 2008 Fed acted aggressively *because* the Great Depression showed the cost of inaction.

## How sovereign debt crises differ

A country with its own currency can't have a classic bank run (it can print money). But:

| Case | Problem |
|---|---|
| **Eurozone** (Greece 2010) | No printing press — like a bank run with no central bank backstop |
| **Emerging markets** (Argentina, Turkey) | Borrow in dollars, earn in local currency. Devaluation makes debt *more expensive* in local terms. "Original sin" — EMs can't borrow internationally in their own currency |

## Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis

Hyman Minsky argued that financial systems are **inherently unstable** — stability breeds instability. Over a prolonged expansion, three types of borrowing units emerge:

1. **Hedge units**: cash flows cover both principal and interest. Safe, conservative.
2. **Speculative units**: cash flows cover interest but not principal. The borrower must roll over debt — relies on continued access to credit.
3. **Ponzi units**: cash flows cover neither principal nor interest. The borrower relies entirely on asset price appreciation to repay. The slightest disruption triggers default.

As the expansion matures, the composition shifts from hedge → speculative → Ponzi. The system becomes fragile. When the first Ponzi units fail, asset prices fall, which forces more units into distress, and the system collapses into a debt-deflation spiral.

Minsky's key insight: **stability is destabilizing**. The longer the good times last, the more risk is accumulated in the tail of the distribution. This contrasts with the prevailing pre-2008 view that markets are self-stabilizing.

The 2008 crisis is a textbook Minsky moment: the housing boom shifted speculative and Ponzi finance to unprecedented scale (subprime mortgages, CDOs, SIVs), and the first price declines triggered a chain reaction. Post-crisis regulation (Dodd-Frank, Basel III) attempts to contain this cycle, but regulatory arbitrage continually pushes risk into less-regulated parts of the system.

## Crisis propagation pattern

```
Credit boom → bubble → trigger → fire sales → insolvency → run → freeze → credit crunch → recession
```

Each crisis follows this pattern. The only difference is the *trigger* and the *type of run*:
- 1929: stock crash → retail bank run
- 2008: housing crash → wholesale funding run
- 2020 (COVID): health shock → corporate bond/Treasury dash-for-cash run (Fed stepped in immediately)
- 2023 (SVB): rate hike → unrealized bond losses → social-media-fueled depositor run on uninsured deposits

### 2022 UK Gilt Crisis: A Modern Shadow-Banking Run

In September 2022, the UK government announced large unfunded tax cuts (the "mini-budget"). Bond markets panicked — gilt (UK government bond) yields surged by 100+ basis points in days. This triggered margin calls on **LDI funds** (liability-driven investment), which are pension fund hedging vehicles:

1. UK pension funds use LDI funds to hedge interest rate risk — they hold gilts and interest rate swaps as collateral
2. When gilt yields spike, the value of LDI collateral falls → LDI funds face margin calls on their swap positions
3. To meet margin calls, LDI funds must sell gilts → selling gilts pushes yields even higher → more margin calls
4. The Bank of England was forced into emergency gilt purchases — **quantitative easing to stop a crisis, not to stimulate the economy**

The 2022 gilt crisis is a classic shadow-banking run: maturity and liquidity transformation in non-bank entities (LDI funds), with no central bank backstop, requiring emergency intervention. It closely mirrors the 2008 repo run (see [shadow-banking.md](shadow-banking.md)), confirming that the crisis propagation pattern is the same regardless of the trigger.
