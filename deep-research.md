# Deep Research

### Goals

i want to research anything and deeply dig the topic, for example: im searching "ancient history", obviously without context and clear purpose any person or machine will confused. I was thinking to let user choose a template for the answer, for example: json format, graph format, text, or maybe combination of each template and the other things is how do we the deep of the research? single keyword like economy can be have lots of meaning and relation to another topics, if we don't limit it, the answer will be to abstract and can be infinite and out of context

### Processing Data

data from internet is unstructured like html, we need to extract information from html to be meaningful data, not only html, files too like pdf, epub, etc ...

### Discovering New Data

Find related information from the data we found, it might be related links, citation, mention, reference, etc... The discovery need to be limited as i mention in goals, it will be to much of information if we don't limit it

### Presenting the Information

How to represent the data we collected? table, pdf, text only, etc...
