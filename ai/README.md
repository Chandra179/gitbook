### (1936) Alan Turing&#x20;

**Paper: “On Computable Numbers”**

* Introduced the concept of a **universal machine** (Turing Machine).
* Solved the fundamental problem: _“What does it mean for something to be computable?”_
* Before this, nobody had a formal definition of an **algorithm**.
* Showed that computation can be represented by a machine following simple step-by-step rules.
* Proved that a single machine can perform **any computation** if given the right instructions.
* This becomes the conceptual basis for **programmable computers**, software, and eventually AI.

**Core contribution:** Defined computation and the idea that one machine can run any program.

### (1943) Warren McCulloch & Walter Pitts&#x20;

**Paper: “A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity”**

* Created the first **mathematical model of a neuron**.
* Showed that neurons can be represented using logic (on/off states).
* Demonstrated that networks of artificial neurons can perform **logical reasoning**.
* Their neuron model became the foundation of **neural networks**.
* Proved: _“Thinking can be expressed as computation.”_

**Core contribution:** Demonstrated that the brain can be modeled using logic and simple computational units.

### (1945) John von Neumann&#x20;

**Work: EDVAC Report — Stored-Program Computer Architecture**

* Designed the architecture of modern computers (CPU + memory + instructions stored in memory).
* Solved the problem of computers being fixed-purpose machines (rewired for each task).
* Enabled computers to run different programs without changing hardware.
* This architecture is still used in **every computer today**, including AI servers.

**Core contribution:** Invented the architecture that allows computers to be programmable.

### (1948) Claude Shannon&#x20;

**Paper: “A Mathematical Theory of Communication”**

* Invented **Information Theory**.
* Defined what **information** is and introduced the concept of **bits**.
* Solved the problem of sending messages reliably through noisy channels.
* Showed how information can be efficiently **encoded, compressed, and transmitted**.
* Becomes essential later for language modeling, compression, and loss functions in ML.

**Core contribution:** Gave the world a way to quantify and handle information.
