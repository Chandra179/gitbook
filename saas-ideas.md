# SaaS Ideas

Restaurant Inventory Forecaster: Predicts prep levels based on local weather, events, and historical sales.

Code Documentation Keeper: Auto-generates and updates documentation whenever code is pushed to Git.

Study Group Matcher: Connects university students in the same (courses, topics) for study sessions. Maybe not just for students, for dedication form group learning max 5. It can be also not for study but for building things, for example i want to build this ... here is my design/approach/proposal/ideas anybody interested can join (with max person set). the project can be labeled as (serious/fun/etc..) so user have choice which kind of project they want to kin. Then user can have their titles to like software engineer. Then have chat or maybe just discord link so we dont maintain the chat. And i think features like spotify wrapped its interesting to be applied in this ideas.
