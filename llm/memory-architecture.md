# Memory Architecture

## **Memory Networks**

To give a neural network **an explicit “memory”** it can read from and write to — instead of storing all knowledge inside its weights. Normally, neural networks “forget” information after training because it’s compressed into parameters. Memory Networks add an **external memory table** (like a database) the model can _look up_ when answering questions. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3916](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3916)

## Neural Turing Machines

To build a neural network that behaves like a **Turing machine** — i.e., it can **read from and write to external memory**, enabling algorithmic reasoning and data manipulation. It’s like giving a neural network its own **RAM**. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401)
