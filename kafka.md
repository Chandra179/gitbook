# Kafka

#### **Kafka Core Concepts**

**Broker**

A Kafka server that stores data and serves client requests. A cluster typically has multiple brokers. Each broker handles some partitions and can be either a leader or follower for them.

**Controller**

One broker in the cluster acts as the controller. It manages partition leadership, reassignments, and handles broker failures.

**Topics**

A logical stream of data identified by a name. Topics are divided into partitions for scalability and parallelism.

**Partition**

A single ordered log within a topic. Each partition is immutable and append-only. Data within a partition is replicated across brokers for fault tolerance.

#### **Producers**

**Publisher**: Application that writes messages into Kafka topics.

**Idempotent Producer**: Guarantees _exactly-once_ semantics for writes, ensuring retries won’t create duplicates.

**Partitioning Strategy**:

* **Key-based hash** → ensures messages with the same key always land in the same partition.
* **Round-robin** → spreads messages evenly across partitions.
* **Custom partitioner** → application-defined placement logic.

#### **Consumers**

* **Subscriber**: Application that reads messages from Kafka topics.
* **group.id**: Identifies a consumer group. Consumers in the same group share the partitions of a topic.
* **\_\_consumer\_offsets**: An internal topic where committed offsets (read positions) are stored.
* **Offset Commit**: The act of saving the last processed record’s position to ensure reliable recovery.
* **Consumer Lag**: The difference between the latest partition offset and the consumer’s committed offset — a measure of how "behind" a consumer is.

#### **Cluster**

* **Cluster**: A set of Kafka brokers working together.
* **Inter-broker Communication**: Brokers exchange replication data, partition metadata, and perform leader election through an inter-broker port.
