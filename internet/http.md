# HTTP

HTTP is a medium to communicate browser (client) to server (e.g, your apps). Every request send from browser to server is **stateless** (server doesn’t remember your previous request unless you use cookies, sessions, or tokens).

* The messages (request) sent is in Plain  text human-readable text (ASCII/UTF-8).
* **Request-response model** → Client asks, server replies.

## HTTP version

### **HTTP/1.0 (1996)**&#x20;

* One TCP connection → one request → one response → then closed.
* When you open a page (each image, CSS, or JS file) = new connection.
* No concept of persistent connection.

**Problems / Limitations:**

* Super inefficient → every page load = hundreds of new TCP handshakes.
* No host header originally → couldn’t host multiple sites on one IP easily.
* Poor caching rules.

### **HTTP/1.1 (1997 – still widely used)**

**Fixes introduced:**

* **Persistent connections** (keep-alive): one TCP connection can handle multiple requests sequentially.
* **Chunked transfer encoding**: stream data without knowing total size upfront.
* **Host header**: enabled virtual hosting (multiple domains on one server/IP).
* Better caching, range requests (download partial files).

**Problems / Limitations:**

* **Head-of-line blocking**: even with keep-alive, requests must go sequentially → one slow response blocks all following ones.
* Lots of redundant headers sent with every request (e.g., `User-Agent`, `Cookies` repeated each time).
* Browsers worked around limits by opening 6–8 TCP connections per domain → wasted resources.

### **HTTP/2 (2015)**

**Fixes introduced:**

* **Binary framing**: replaced text protocol with compact binary → faster parsing, less overhead.
* **Multiplexing**: multiple requests/responses at once over a single TCP connection (no blocking).
* **Header compression (HPACK)**: repeated headers compressed efficiently.
* **Server push**: server can proactively send assets client will need.

**Problems / Limitations:**

* Still built on **TCP** → if one packet is lost, the entire TCP stream stalls (head-of-line blocking at transport layer).
* Server push ended up underused/abused (sent too much, wasted bandwidth).
* Complex debugging compared to plain text HTTP/1.1.

### **HTTP/3 (2020s, now rolling out)**

**Fixes introduced:**

* Runs on **QUIC (built on UDP)** instead of TCP.
* Eliminates transport-level head-of-line blocking: if one packet is lost, only that stream is affected, not the whole connection.
* Faster connection setup → 0-RTT handshakes with TLS 1.3 baked in.
* Connection migration → if you switch networks (Wi-Fi → 4G), session persists without reconnect.

**Problems / Tradeoffs:**

* More CPU intensive (encryption mandatory, QUIC is complex).
* Firewalls/middleboxes sometimes block UDP → fallback to HTTP/2.
* Debugging is harder than TCP-based protocols.
