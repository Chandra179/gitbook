# Strings

Using `+=` for string concatenation is **inefficient approach** especially when working with large or numerous strings. Here’s why:

1. **String Immutability**: Strings in Go are immutable, meaning they can’t be modified after creation. Every time you use `+=` to append to a string, Go creates a completely new string that combines the original with the new part. The previous strings are discarded, and the program needs to reallocate memory for each new string. This causes a lot of unnecessary memory allocation and copying.
2. **Performance Bottleneck**: With each new allocation, the previous memory allocation becomes unused, leading to **more garbage collection work**. As the number of concatenations grows, this approach can significantly impact performance, causing a slowdown that increases with the number of concatenated parts.

```go
func concat(values []string) string { // ["hello", "world", "!"]
    s := ""
    for _, value := range values {
        s += value // Each iteration creates a new string in memory
    }
    return s
}

// 0xx1 hello
// 0xx2 hello world
// 0xx3 hello world !
```

### The Solution: Using "`strings.Builder"` <a href="#id-9498" id="id-9498"></a>

`strings.Builder` manages an **internal byte slice (buffer)** where it accumulates the strings you append, without creating a new string every time. This approach is both faster and more memory-efficient because it minimizes the number of allocations.

Here’s how `strings.Builder` works:

* The `Builder` starts with an **empty internal buffer**.
* Each time you call `WriteString`, it appends the new string’s bytes to this buffer.
* Once you’ve added all the parts, calling `String()` on the `Builder` reads the buffer’s contents as a single string.

```
import "strings"

func concat(values []string) string {
    var sb strings.Builder
    for _, value := range values {
        sb.WriteString(value) // Appends each string to the internal buffer
    }
    return sb.String() // Converts the entire buffer to a single string
}
```

#### Why This is Better <a href="#id-346d" id="id-346d"></a>

1. **Reduced Allocations**: `strings.Builder` minimizes the number of memory allocations by maintaining a single buffer, which grows only as needed.
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Since it uses a single internal buffer for all the strings, there is less memory copying, resulting in better overall memory use.
3. **Improved Performance**: By avoiding frequent reallocations, `strings.Builder` performs faster when working with a large number of strings.

### Enhancing Efficiency Further with `Grow` <a href="#id-1b3d" id="id-1b3d"></a>

If you know the total size of the final concatenated string in advance, you can use `Builder`'s `Grow` method to pre-allocate the required memory. This avoids the cost of dynamically resizing the buffer as you add strings, making it even more efficient.

```go
func concat(values []string) string {
    total := 0
    for _, value := range values {
        total += len(value)
    }
    
    var sb strings.Builder
    sb.Grow(total) // Pre-allocate space for total bytes

    for _, value := range values {
        sb.WriteString(value)
    }
    return sb.String()
}
```

### When to Use `strings.Builder` <a href="#c5f0" id="c5f0"></a>

In general, `strings.Builder` is preferable for concatenating multiple strings, especially if you’re dealing with loops or a large number of concatenations. As a rule of thumb:

* Use `strings.Builder` when concatenating more than a few strings
* Consider using `Grow` if you have a good estimate of the final string size.
